    <p><a href="{% url 'shortener-list' %}"><strong>Psinergy.Link</strong></a> functions as a hyperlink (URL) shortener.</p>

    <p>Click the '<strong>Shorten Link</strong>' button, then simply paste the link into the Long URL text box. Then click '<strong>Shorten</strong>'.</p>

    <p>After creating the shortened link, a detail page is presented so that both the <strong>Title</strong> <u>and</u> <strong>Shortened URL</strong> can be copied together. Next, when it is pasted they'll be able to see what the short URL is referring to. It's also for your own reference.</p>

    <p>All new shortened links are presented at the top row on the <strong>Recent</strong> page.</p>

    <p>Click '<strong>Recent</strong>' to view the most recently shortened URLs.</p>

    <p>Click '<strong>Top</strong>' to view the most clicked URLs in descending order.</p>

    <p>The website will inform you if the URL you're trying to shorten was shortened already, either by you or someone else. This is so that the same short link is shared by everyone for the same online content.</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Unfortunately, for websites that use Cloudflare or skill testing Captchas, this site is not able to acquire webpage titles at this time. Websites such as ResearchGate, MDPI, IEEE, Wiley, to name a few use these security methods. Because of this, the Title may say "Title not available". Titles can be edited later, simply grab the title from the original website.</p>
