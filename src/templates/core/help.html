    <p><a href="{% url 'shortener-list' %}"><strong>Psinergy.Link</strong></a> functions as a hyperlink (URL) shortener.</p>

    <p>Simply paste the link into the URL box, then click '<strong>Shorten</strong>'.</p>

    <p>After creating a shortened link, a detail page is presented so that you can copy both the <strong>Title</strong> <u>and</u> <strong>Shortened URL</strong> together. When you paste it, people will be able to see what that short URL is referring to. It is also for your own reference.</p>

    <p>The shortened version of the URL will be presented at the top row on the <strong>Recent</strong> page. Copy that link then paste it anywhere.</p>

    <p>Click '<strong>Recent</strong>' to view the most recently shortened URLs.</p>

    <p>Click '<strong>Top</strong>' to view the most clicked URLs in descending order.</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Unfortunately, for websites that use Cloudflare or skill testing Captchas, this site is not able to acquire webpage titles at this time. Websites such as ResearchGate, MDPI, IEEE, Wiley, to name a few use these security methods. Because of this, the Title may say "Title not available" for the shortened link. Each link may be edited later, simply grab the title from the original website using your web browser.</p>
