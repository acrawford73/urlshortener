    <h2 class="mt-5"><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br />

    <h5>A. Promote truth and intellectual accountability.</h5>
    <h5>B. Promote awareness of Biodigital Convergence related technologies.</h5><br />

    <p>Whenever anyone sees '<strong>psinergy.link/abc123</strong>', they should assume they'll see a <u>Psinergist curated</u> industry- or science-based research paper, journal, website article, patent, podcast, video, etc.</p><br />

    <p><strong>Please follow these guidelines:</strong></p>

    <p>
      <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
        <li class="list-group-item">This website is for Psinergist researchers only. Please <u>do not</u> share your login.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Please focus on shortening links that are topics related to <strong>Biodigital Convergence</strong>. Some exceptions are allowed.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Please steer the truth toward fact/truthful content only. Theories are distractions.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Any valid URL can be shortened. However, this service was mainly intended for very long URLs, such as those ugly Google search links.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">If you have the knowledge to do so, please remove tracking tags in the URLs before you shorten them. You can edit them later if needed.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Please refrain from shortening direct links to PDF files. Some browsers try to load the PDF file right in the browser instead of downloading it, which can be an issue for older devices.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Secure URLs beginning with &quot;HTTPS&quot; are preferred.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Please <u>do not</u> shorten links that most people would interpret as offensive or malicious.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><u>Do not</u> shorten affiliate links and <u>do not</u> promote crypto-currency. If caught, the account will be disabled and shortened links will be removed.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Please govern yourself accordingly.</li>
      </ol>
