    <p>Whenever anyone sees '<strong>psinergy.link/abc123</strong>', they should assume they'll see a <u>Psinergist curated</u> industry/science-based research paper, journal, website article, patent, podcast, video, etc.</p><br />

    <p><strong>Please follow these guidelines:</strong></p>

    <p>
      <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
        <li class="list-group-item">The management area of this website is for trusted Psinergist researchers. Please <u>do not</u> share your login.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Please focus on shortening links that are topics related to <strong>Biodigital Convergence</strong>. Some exceptions are also appreciated: crystals, health, music, history, and the truly fascinating.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Please steer the links toward fact-based content only. Theories are distractions.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">If you have the knowledge to do so, please remove tracking tags in the URLs before you shorten them. You can edit them later if needed.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Please refrain from shortening direct links to PDF files or images. Some browsers try to load the PDF file right in the browser instead of downloading it, which can cause loading issues with older devices.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Secure URLs beginning with &quot;HTTPS&quot; are preferred. Most browsers demand secure URLs anyway.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Please <u>do not</u> shorten links that most people would interpret as offensive or malicious.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><u>Do not</u> shorten affiliate links and <u>do not</u> promote crypto-currency. If caught, the account will be disabled and shortened links will be removed.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Please avoid posting political motivated content.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Please govern yourself accordingly.</li>
      </ol>
